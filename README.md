# Gimp Plugin for Extracting Single-Cards from TableTopSimulator Images
Most TableTop Simulator Mods have Images with many cards of the game on it. <br>
if you want to print these cards as proxies , for examples for games out of print or not yet in print, <br>
it is convenient to have a plugin that extract each card from the Image.<br>
The file has to be put in a folder of the same name as the file (without-py-extension). this folder has to be in the plugin-folder of Gimp3.<br>

Keep in mind, that a syntax-error in the plugin can force gimp not showing up the plugin. for example a missing bracket can force this.<br>
when using the Development version of Gimp , you have a console-window where you can see possible problems or errors.<br>


the output-directory is C:\users\your_username\ <br>
Actual tested with Gimp3.1.4 <br>
The output format is *.png 

Actual tested with Gimp3.1.4 <br>
Should work with Current Stable release of Gimp3
