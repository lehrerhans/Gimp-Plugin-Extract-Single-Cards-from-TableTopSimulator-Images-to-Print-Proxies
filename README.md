# Gimp Plugin for Extracting Single-Cards from TableTopSimulator Images
Most TableTop Simulator Mods have Images with many cards of the game on it. if you want to print these cards as proxies , for examples for games out of print or not yet in print, it is convenient to have a plugin that extract each card from the Image.
The file has to be put in a folder of the same name as the file (without-py-extension). this folder has to be in the plugin-folder of Gimp3.

Keep in mind, that a syntax-error in the plugin can force gimp not showing up the plugin. for example a missing bracket can force this.
when using the Development version of Gimp , you have a console-window where you can see possible problems or errors.

the output-directory is C:\users\your_username\
The outout format is *.png

Actual tested with Gimp3.1.4
