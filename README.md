# Gimp-Plugin-Extract-Single-Cards-from-TableTopSimulator-Images-to-Print-Proxies
Most TableTop Simulator Mods have Images with many cards of the game on it. if you want to print these cards as proxies , for examples for games out of print or not yet in print, it is convenient to have a plugin that extract each card from the Image.
The file has to be put in a folder of the same name as the file (witout-py-extension). this folder has to be in the plugin-folder of Gimp3.
